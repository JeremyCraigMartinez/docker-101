This is Docker 101, a metacognitive approach. Here, you will find similar beginning content that you might find in another online introductory course. What sets this course apart is the surrounding curriculum. Metacognitive learning habits were studied and applied to this online course.

Metacognition is thinking about thinking (Flavell, 1979). It seems trivial, and yet, many of us do not do it well. When one thinks metacognitively, they are reflecting on their own thought process, optimizing learning patters and strategies, estimating performance, planning for future learning, etc. Metacognition is comprised of two major parts: metacognitive knowledge and metacognition regulation. (Coutinho, 2007). Metacognitive knowledge involves cognitive awareness, awareness of which learning strategies work well for you, how your thought process finds solutions, and leveraging this while approaching future problem solving. Mental regulation refers to actively managing mental processes, such as planning, monitoring comprehension, evaluation, etc. (Schraw and Dennison, 1994).

Metacognition has had little to no presence in massive open online courses’ (MOOC). Some institutions are better at this than others, namely Georgia Tech’s OMSCS. However, it is still expensive relative to other MOOCs. More affordable options like Udemy, Kahn Academy, and Udacity (without OMSCS) could work in learnings of existing research.

## Topics covered

- General containerization concepts
- Docker images
- Docker containers
- Docker volumes
- Docker networks
- Containerized services (using Docker)

The sequence of this course differs, too. In Docker 101, the student is given autonomy over their curriculum. The six weeks of content is pre-set, however, it is up to you to choose in what order you learn them. The web of subjects is represented in the blue hexagons in the banner.

- Week 1
  - Containerization concepts
- Weeks 2-3 (in whichever order you see fit)
  - Docker images
  - Docker containers
- Weeks 4-6 (in whichever order you see fit)
  - Docker volumes
  - Docker networks
  - Containerized services
