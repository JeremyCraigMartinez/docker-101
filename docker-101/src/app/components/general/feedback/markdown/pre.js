Royce Sadler identifies three prerequisites for students to benefit from peer feedback in academic tasks. A student must know

1. What a good performance is (i.e. must possess a concept of the goal or standard being aimed for);
2. how current performance relates to good performance (for this, students must be able to compare current and good performance);
3. how to act to close the gap between current and good performance.

From this, Sadler points out that for students to be able to gauge current performance against good performance (ii), and act on that knowledge to close the gap (iii), students must “already possess some of the same evaluative skills as their teacher” (Sadler, 1989).

In this course, we want to opt for full transparency so that a student can understand exactly what is required for each assignment, what key performance indicators (KPI) of learning looks like, how the assignment will be graded, what a good submission looks like, and what poor submissions look like. __Much of this was outlined in the assignment description, however, if any of this is still unclear, please consult the [Q & A board](/docker-101/#/qa).__

## Good peer feedback...

- helps clarify what good performance is (goals, criteria, expected standards);
- facilitates the development of self-assessment (reflection) in learning;
- delivers high quality information to students about their learning;
- encourages teacher and peer dialogue around learning;
- encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem;
- provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance;
- provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape the teaching.
